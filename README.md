# BigRational number system and Geometric primitives.
This is the one of the five parts of a larger project made by a class of 21 students to quantify, interpret and perform operations on spatial data and geometrical structures.The repository of the larger project can be found here:https://github.com/mickeymv/spatialDB

The part of the project in this repository, covers the creation of a Big Number system and the definition of fundamental geometric primititves such as lines, points, polygons etc. and defining properities and relations between them.

The Big Number system allows us to store precision detail about the geometric dimensions so that no rounding error occurs and any geometric/spatial figure is represented precisely, in its entirety.

The second portion of the project, contains an implementation of basic geometric primitives such as points, lines, polygons and functions that accompnay their use, such as determining the relation between a point and a line in a spatial manner, determining whether a point lies inside an n-sided polygon, The relation of a line and a polygon is pace etc.

This serves to form the base layer upon which further topological relationships can be explored and complex operations such as the plane sweep and complex hull algorithms can be performed.
