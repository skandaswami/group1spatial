# This is a repository that contains the implementation of a Big Number system and a set of geometric primitives.
Implementation of BigRational and Geometric primitives
This is the one of the five parts of a larger project made by a class of 21 students to quantify, interpret and perform operations on spatial data and geometrical structures.
This involved the creation of a Big Number system and the definition of fundamental geometric primititves such as lines, points, polygons etc. and defining properities and relations between them.
Several functions such as determining the position of a point relative to a polygon were implemented.
